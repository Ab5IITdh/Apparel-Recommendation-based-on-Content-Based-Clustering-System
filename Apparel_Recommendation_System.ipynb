For example, when you type a query to search for some product on Amazon, the search engine will map your query against a set of keys (featues and feature matrix) associated with candidate products in the database, then present you the best matched videos (values/pdsit in this notebook).

    "As you can see the system is quite accurately giving us the product recommendation. I think the BOW model is giving us quite a good variety of products and also displaying different types of brands. In tfidf model, the products are quite restricted to being similar and of the same brand but BOW is giving us a better variety since it is changing the brands.\n",

    "Due to time constraints and an easy to use application, I used only around 17k data points, if you have time to spare you can get even better results by not dropping the null values. On the other hand, removing duplicates was quite important as in the last fewer words the only thing irrelavant was the size of the apparel, it is pretty obvious the customer doesn't want to see the exact same product with only a change in the size, hence removing it was a must.\n",
